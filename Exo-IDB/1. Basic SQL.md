## Problem 1

Return the value of attribute Number of all accounts owned by customers called “John Doe”.

```sql
SELECT Number
FROM Account, Customer
WHERE ID = CustID and Name = "John Doe";
```

```sql
SELECT Number
FROM Account JOIN Customer ON Customer.ID = Account.CustID
WHERE Customer.Name = "John Doe";
```

Return Number and Branch of all accounts owned by a customer with ID “xyz123”, only if there is such a customer in the CustomeR table.

```sql
SELECT Number, Branch
FROM Account JOIN Customer ON Customer.ID = Account.CustID
WHERE Customer.ID = "xyz123";
```

Return Number and Balance of all overdrawn accounts in the “London” branch.

```sql
SELECT Number, Balance
FROM Account
WHERE Balance < 0 AND Branch = "London";
```

Return all pairs (Name, Number) where Name is the name of a customer and Number is the number of an account owned by that customer, such that the branch of the account is in a different city than the one where the customer lives.

```sql
SELECT Name, Number
FROM Customer, Account
WHERE ID = CustID AND Branch <> City;
```

## Problem 2

```sql
SELECT C1 . id , C1 . name , C1 . c i t y
FROM Customer C1 , Customer C2
WHERE C1 . i d = C2 . i d AND ( C1 . name <> C2 . name OR C1 . c i t y <> C2 . c i t y );
```

rien car il y a une contrainte unique.

## Problem 3

Describe a situation in which a query keeps working without errors after a change of the given schema, but produces a different answer than what was originally intended, and discuss how the situation could be avoided with an appropriate use of table aliases and qualification of attributes.

Si on fait un `FROM table1, table2` et que les deux ont une colonne avec le même nom.
